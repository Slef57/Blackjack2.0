I am Lefteris Melles, and I am a 2nd-year undergraduate student in the Department of Information Technology and Electronic Systems Engineering at the International Hellenic University.
In the context of the "Computer - Human interaction" course, I was asked to make this specific application.
I submitted this project as it is right now, but I am planning to add more features and fix many bugs that the current version has.
Right now its version 2.0 because I have already made a version 1.0 that was a non GUI version of the application, just printing the messages in the terminal.
